1. The insights that I want to discover using the YELP API Fusion is what are people in NYC looking for when they buy bagels. For example, are they looking for customer service, for taste, for origininality, etc. Finding this would give me insight into understanding how to conduct a successful restaurant. Due to this, the search parameters that I chose to do were bagel (term), New York City (location) and sort by reviews. These parameters would give me the top 20 bagel restaurants in New York City, from which I would choose 5 to conduct a text/sentiment analysis to gather deeper understanding for what customers look for. To do this I used tokens which broke apart the textual data to find parts of speech, such as adjectives, superlative adjectives, and nouns. This would help me gain a quicker insight into the most descriptive parts of their reviews and understand what stood out the most to them more efficiently. 
2. The first restaurant that I looked into was Black Star Bakery Caf�. These first review highlighted and praised the customer service describing it as �impeccable� and stating that the server was an �absolute Rockstar.� While the other two reviews did not mention the service, they did commend the overall breakfast menu and coffee, using words such as �great� and �delicious.� The second restaurant, The Lazy Llama Coffee Bar also focused a lot on the service, with one describing it as their �go-to.� They also enjoy the variety in food menu and drink items, with one saying that they enjoy that they offer both �hot and cold drinks.� As for Avenue x Bagels Brooklyn, they went the classic route of bagel with cream cheese and were very satisfied. Along with this they also mentioned how it�s their daily spot for their morning coffee. Finally, they pointed out the service as �fast� and �great.� I also looked into Brooklyn Bagel and Coffee Company which stood out to customers due to their �great� coffee and service. Another customer exalted about not only the taste of the food, but also the portions, saying how there was �plenty� of cream cheese with their bagel. Finally, I did Russ and Daughters Caf�, which was also applauded for their service which was described as �great�, along with their everything bagel with lox and cream cheese. With these reviews, I can conclude that when people go for a bagel, they often do not only go for a bagel but for an experience. They care about the quality of service, but also want to see a variety of menu options, therefore they don�t want it to be only limited to bagels. Furthermore, not only do they want coffee, but also variations in drinks. Finally, the classics should be perfected to stand out with generous portions, such as the original bagel with cream cheese to the everything bagel with lox. Overall, the top bagel restaurants in New York City focus on offering more to the customers than just bagels which is very important to consider.
